      Hi welcome to my About me page. I stated my coding jurney just after turning 28 when i was talking with a friend trying to figure out what i wanted to do in lfie. He mentioned that I should look into coding since I have always loved gaming and being on a computer. This converation started a spark in me that i never knew excited. I dove head first into coding and was able to find my passion. I hope to one day take what i learn  and will contuine to learn and move into game development. I hope you like what you see!
